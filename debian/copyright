Comment:
 From Changes, 2.039:
 .
 - Code in the PDF::API2::Basic::PDF namespace was originally licensed under
   the Perl Artistic License, which has been determined to not be
   (L)GPL-compatible.  Martin Hosken has graciously granted an MIT license
   for use of his code contained in PDF::API2, so the distribution may now be
   used solely under the terms of the LGPL rather than requiring both
   licenses simultaneously.  Many thanks to Petr Pisar for his help in
   working through the licensing issues.
